"""ARCHITECTURE.md Rule 2, enforced: core prose is library-neutral.

Coupling lives in prose before it lives in code, and no ordinary test
guards prose — so this one does, structurally (L18: a duty-enforced
prose rule would not survive). Any line of ``src/stelling`` naming a
specific library must be a marked provenance citation: the SAME line
must carry ``census`` (or cite a ``design/`` record). Outward references
("library X's operator", "the X attachment's shape") have no marker and
fail here, named file:line.

The pre-commit hook ``library-identifier-hygiene`` in
.pre-commit-config.yaml enforces the same rule as a grep; the two are
deliberately logically identical — a divergence between them is a bug.
``tests/`` and ``corpus/`` are out of scope by design: census-binding
tests and campaign exhibits name their contacts as provenance by nature.

    renamed test turns it into a claim about nothing.

    `src/stelling` cites tests by `path::name` in nineteen places. Those
    citations are how a reader checks that a guard is pinned rather than
    asserted, and nothing kept them true: commit `218f969` renamed
    `test_a_ONE_SHOT_records_cannot_silence_the_bar` to
    `test_a_ONE_SHOT_records_behaves_EXACTLY_LIKE_THE_TUPLE_it_yields` and left
    `solvers.py`'s citation of the old name behind. It was the only dangling
    one, and it was found by reading rather than by anything running.

    Resolved by SOURCE rather than by collection: a `FunctionDef` of that name
    in the cited file. A collection-based check would go quiet in the zero-dep
    column, where the jax-only files never collect — and the citations are in
    prose that ships either way.

    **PARSED, NOT GREPPED, AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS MEASURED.** `f"def {name}("
    in body` is a raw substring test over file TEXT, so anything that spells
    those characters satisfies it — including the two most ordinary ways a test
    stops existing. Driven at `faefc48`:

        the cited family renamed away entirely     1 failed  (not vacuous)
        the family gone, one `# def test_…(`       1 PASSED
        the exact citation's `def` commented out   1 PASSED
        the `def` gone, a string-literal mention   1 PASSED

    Commenting a test out is how a test most often stops existing, and it
    defeated this check completely. `ast.parse` is equally independent of
    collection — it reads the file and imports nothing — so the reason this
    docstring gives for avoiding collection costs nothing here.

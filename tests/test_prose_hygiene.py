"""ARCHITECTURE.md Rule 2, enforced: core prose is library-neutral.

Coupling lives in prose before it lives in code, and no ordinary test
guards prose — so this one does, structurally (L18: a duty-enforced
prose rule would not survive). Any line of ``src/stelling`` naming a
specific library must be a marked provenance citation: the SAME line
must carry ``census`` (or cite a ``design/`` record). Outward references
("library X's operator", "the X attachment's shape") have no marker and
fail here, named file:line.

The pre-commit hook ``library-identifier-hygiene`` in
.pre-commit-config.yaml enforces the same rule as a grep; the two are
deliberately logically identical — a divergence between them is a bug.
``tests/`` and ``corpus/`` are out of scope by design: census-binding
tests and campaign exhibits name their contacts as provenance by nature.

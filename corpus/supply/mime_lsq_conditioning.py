"""The LA contract attached to the REAL MIME least-squares gradient.

Target: mime-engine @ 7ce1efb4311b, ``src/mime/nodes/environment/fvm/``
(operators.py + mesh.py — the only two sim files this script reads or
imports from). The call site is ``grad_least_squares(phi, mesh,
boundary_face_values=None, *, reg=1e-30)`` (operators.py:119-172): per
cell P it assembles the normal matrix ``M_P = Σ_f d_f ⊗ d_f`` over the
face stencil plus ``reg·I`` and solves via ``jnp.linalg.inv`` + einsum.
The contract is :func:`stelling.contracts.conditioning_2x2_field` — the
requires face (M well-conditioned, per cell, closed form) mechanized
through the ONE stelling pipeline; the ensures face (norm-sensitivity of
the solve output) DECLARED, never checked.

Structure, in order:

* **seam** — what actually happens when ``jax.ops.segment_sum`` (the
  real assembly's reduction) meets stelling's propagation: measured, not
  assumed.
* **fidelity check F (mandatory, first)** — the unrolled transcription
  (M, MIME's rhs recomputed the same unrolled way, ``jnp.linalg.inv`` +
  einsum exactly as operators.py:167-171) against the REAL imported
  ``grad_least_squares``, random phi (fixed seed), in BOTH
  configurations (boundary-starved ``None`` / boundary-fed all-patches),
  on TWO meshes: the 2x1 the KAs are about AND a 3x2 whose cell stencils
  are non-congruent (on 2x1 alone, cell-permuting/role-swapping
  mutations of the assembly produce the correct values — degenerate
  evidence). Layered with exact M cross-checks in both configurations
  and the reg signature pin, because each layer has a measured blind
  spot (a 10x reg error is invisible to F alone: absorbed in fed,
  nullspace-aligned in starved). A transcription that cannot be tied to
  the real function this way is not an attachment.
* **KA-A** — the scar: the DEFAULT call (``boundary_face_values=None``)
  is boundary-starved; on the smallest interior-face mesh each cell's M
  is the rank-1 one-face stencil + reg. Expected REFUTED on intervals
  alone, per cell.
* **KA-B** — the same mesh boundary-fed (all four patches present):
  healthy M, VERIFIED, with the vacuity instrument's inert line recorded
  verbatim (all-point envelope).
* **KA-C** — declared boxes on the delta components: the requires over a
  FAMILY of axis-aligned geometries; interval straddle quoted, solver
  VERIFIED (QF_NRA) on the narrow region, solver REFUTED with a
  replay-confirmed witness on the widened region, the witness's
  condition number re-derived exactly in-script.

Everything asserted below is a hard gate: the script is its own check.
MIME is exercised, never edited. Run:

    $SP/venv-jax/bin/python corpus/supply/mime_lsq_conditioning.py

Precision, recorded: ``jax_enable_x64=True`` before any tracing, and the
mesh is constructed with ``dtype=jnp.float64`` (the constructor DEFAULTS
to ``jnp.float32`` — mesh.py:229; the probe arithmetic this attaches to
is binary64). The actual mesh array dtypes are printed and asserted.

# * the exact M cross-checks (transcribed M == segment_sum rebuild, BOTH
#   configurations) pin the assembled VALUES;
# * reg is ALSO pinned by reading and asserting the real signature
#   default (top of this script) — because a 10x reg error (1e-29 for
#   1e-30) is invisible to F alone in BOTH configurations: absorbed in
#   fed (0.3125 + 1e-29 == 0.3125 in binary64, so even exact == on the
#   fed M passes) and nullspace-aligned in starved (rhs = [c, 0.0]
#   exactly on this mesh, so F observes only the first column of M⁻¹ and

#   cross-check catches it by value (1e-29 != 1e-30 where the entry IS
#   reg).
#
# Adoption warning: a reader copying this pattern onto a solver whose
# regulariser (or any absorbed parameter) is NOT signature-readable must
# pin it by construction — F cannot see that class of error.
#
# The 2x1 mesh alone is DEGENERATE fidelity evidence: both cells'
# stencils are congruent, so cell-permuting / role-swapping / sign-
# flipping mutations of the assembly produce the CORRECT M values there.
# The full stack therefore also runs on a 3x2 mesh, whose cell stencils
# are non-congruent (corner/edge cells differ in the fed config;
# interior-face counts differ per cell in the starved config). Measured
# residual even there: mutations value-identical BY ALGEBRA on every
# Cartesian box — transposing the symmetric M, swapping the
# owner/neighbour roles in its sum, sign flips under d⊗d, and the 180°
# cell permutation (the constructor's boxes are centro-symmetric) —
# are undetectable by value comparison on ANY such mesh.

# posed over a declared envelope, and a point envelope is still an
# envelope — this is the same code path an adopter will use with real
# ranges (KA-C widens exactly these declarations into boxes). The

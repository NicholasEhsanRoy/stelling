# Contributing

## Setup

```sh
pip install -e ".[solvers,jax]" --group dev   # pip ≥ 25.1; uv works too
pre-commit install
pytest
```

## Sign your commits

Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` line (`git commit -s`), certifying
the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO). CI enforces this on pull
requests.

This is provenance, not bureaucracy. stelling's ambition is to be usable in
qualification-grade settings, and the chain that supports that is: SPDX
headers say what license every line is under, DCO sign-offs say who asserted
the right to contribute each change, and PEP 740 attestations bind each
released wheel to the exact commit and workflow that built it. The sign-off
is the one link only contributors can provide, and it cannot be retrofitted
later.

**There is no CLA, and none is planned.** You keep your copyright; the DCO
is an assertion of provenance, not an assignment of rights.

## Invariants get tests that they can't drift

**Invariants that must not drift get a test that they can't, not a
convention that they shouldn't.** Worked examples already in-tree: jax may
be imported only in `_jax_compat.py` (enforced by a pre-commit grep *and* a
test, not a comment), and `TESTED_JAX_SERIES` must be a hardcoded literal
independent of packaging metadata (an AST assertion), with a companion test
that fails the moment CI's jax outruns it — so bumping the tested series is
a conscious act, never a drift.

Pending instances, recorded now so they land with the features they bind:

- **Never invoke a solver on defaults** — a test asserting every invocation
  path passes a complete explicit option set. Lands with the first solver
  call.
- **Never emit a verdict without a complete stamp** — a test asserting every
  field of the SOUNDNESS.md stamp contract is populated, failing on a
  missing field rather than defaulting it. Lands with the first verdict.
  The contract grows over time (it just gained a precision field), and a
  stamp that silently omits a field is worse than one that doesn't exist.

## Ground rules

- SPDX headers are inserted automatically by the pre-commit hook; don't
  fight it.
- Only `src/stelling/_jax_compat.py` may import jax. Everything else
  consumes the jax-free `stelling.ir`. Private jax modules are banned
  everywhere. Both rules are enforced by a pre-commit hook and by tests.
- Any change that can flip a verdict on any query is a soundness event and
  needs an entry in [SOUNDNESS.md](SOUNDNESS.md), whatever the semver bump
  says.

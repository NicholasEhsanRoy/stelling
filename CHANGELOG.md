# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — unreleased

### New transfers and precision improvements

- **`is_finite` transfer**: returns definite-true for bounded intervals,
  definite-false for point-at-infinity (`[inf, inf]`), unknown otherwise.
  Unlocks the `jnp.where(jnp.isfinite(x), ...)` pattern that MADDENING's
  Aitken relaxation depends on — `select_n` can now prune unreachable
  branches when the selector's `isfinite` result is decidable.

- **`int64→float64` point-interval conversion rule**: when an integer
  constant is cast to float64 and is exactly representable (in [-2^53,
  2^53]), the interval passes through instead of declining to top.
  Unblocks 41 jax-md `safe_mask` sites.

- **Boundary-aware division**: when the divisor has zero at exactly one
  boundary (`[0, hi]` or `[lo, 0]`) — the case `assume(x > 0)` produces
  — compute a meaningful result instead of declining. True straddles and
  point-at-zero still decline with an actionable message.

- **Div-straddle decline**: when float division has a divisor spanning
  zero (true straddle), the transfer now declines with a message naming
  the interval and suggesting remedies, instead of silently returning
  `[-inf, inf]`.

### Float32 / float16 / bfloat16 IEEE mode

- **Format-parametric IEEE semantics**: the existing `semantics="ieee"`
  mode (previously binary64-only) now supports all four catalogued
  formats. Each operation rounds interval endpoints outward to the target
  format's ULP grid, models per-format subnormal flush, and handles
  format-specific overflow.

- **IEEE assume-bump** (`_format_nextafter`): `assume(x > k)` in IEEE
  mode narrows to `[nextafter_fmt(k, +inf), hi]` — the smallest
  representable value strictly above k in the target format. Works for
  all k, all formats. In combination with boundary-aware division, the
  `assume(b > 0); a / b` pattern produces decidable quotients.

### Verification pipeline

- **Reachability conjunct**: a backward walk from the jaxpr's outputs
  identifies variables that flow to an output. Violated obligations on
  "dead" variables (computed but never observed by the caller) are
  downgraded from REFUTED to UNKNOWN with a note. The fail-safe is
  always REFUTED: obligations that cannot be proven dead keep their
  status.

- **Solver selection API**: `check(..., solver="z3")` or `solver="cvc5"`
  restricts the SMT portfolio to one backend. The verdict explicitly
  discloses degraded redundancy.

### SMT emission extensions

- **`is_finite` emission** (guarded): emits constant `true` when the
  operand's propagated interval has finite endpoints; declines when
  infinite (sound: bounded reals are finite by construction). Unblocks
  solver escalation on every harness containing `jnp.isfinite()`.

- **`pow` emission** (integer AND rational exponents): integer exponents
  (`x**2`, `x**3`, `x**(-1)`) expand to explicit products. Rational
  exponents (`x**(1/2)`, `x**(1/3)`, `x**(2/3)`, up to `x**(1/80)`) emit
  as auxiliary-variable polynomial constraints (`y^q = x^p` with sign
  constraints) — both z3 and cvc5 handle these in QF_NRA. Denominator
  capped at 128; base must be non-negative (JAX returns NaN for
  `pow(negative, fractional)`).

- **Relational assumes forwarded to solver**: when `assume(e1 < e2)`
  involves two variable operands (a constraint the interval domain cannot
  apply), the comparison is recorded and emitted as a positive axiom
  alongside the negated obligation. The solver sees the full constraint
  set.

- **z3 tactic workaround for high-degree polynomials**: when a solver
  obligation contains a rational-pow auxiliary variable (`y^q = x^p`
  encoding), z3 uses a custom tactic chain (`simplify`, `solve-eqs`,
  `factor`, `purify-arith`, `tseitin-cnf`, `nlsat`) instead of the
  default `Solver()`. This restores the z3 cross-check on high-degree
  polynomials (measured: d=80 from 10s+ timeout to 0.35-0.6s). The tactic
  is activated automatically; cvc5 handles these natively.

- **Per-obligation withholding refinement**: when relational assumes are
  only partially emitted for a given obligation slice (some operands fall
  outside the backward cone), the solver ran over a wider domain than
  intended. The per-obligation withholding now un-withholds a violation
  ONLY when ALL relational assumes were actually emitted for that specific
  obligation's script — a genuine violation from the constrained domain.

- **Emission guards resolve through inlined aliases**: guards (div, is_finite)
  now follow the slicer's alias chain to find propagated intervals for
  variables defined inside transparent calls (jit, custom_jvp_call).

### Inductive step verification

- **`stelling.inductive.check_inductive_step`**: verify that a loop body
  preserves declared bounds in one step. VERIFIED means the invariant
  holds for all iterations by induction. Constructs the harness
  automatically from the body function and declared state bounds.
  Supports scalar and array-shaped state variables (shape specified per
  variable in the bounds declaration).

### Known limitations (0.2.0)

- `assume(x > 0)` in real mode still narrows to `[0, hi]` (closed
  intervals cannot represent open bounds in exact reals). The IEEE bump
  is exact; the real-mode overapproximation is sound. In real mode,
  boundary-aware division handles the resulting `[0, hi]` gracefully.
- The dependency problem (A ∧ ¬A = unknown in intervals) is inherent to
  the non-relational domain. Solver escalation is the designed remedy.
- Rational pow requires non-negative base (JAX returns NaN for
  `pow(negative, fractional)`). Denominator capped at 128 to bound
  polynomial degree.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-12

Initial release.

### Static verification

- Forward interval propagation over the jax-free IR, outward-rounded (one
  deliberate ulp per operation), with three-valued verdicts: VERIFIED,
  REFUTED, UNKNOWN.
- SMT escalation via an optional portfolio (cvc5 for nonlinear, Z3 for
  linear, cross-checked when both are installed). REFUTED verdicts carry a
  concrete witness confirmed by exact-rational replay.
- Every verdict carries a full stamp: versions, query content hash,
  arithmetic mode and semantics, precision configuration, solver
  invocations (or their recorded absence), transfer tiers and provenance,
  assumptions, and coverage.
- Precondition obligation templates (`field_positive`, `scalar_nonzero`)
  with a one-call entry point (`check()`).
- Vacuity checking (two modes: `inputs-only`, `all`) built into the
  pipeline — a VERIFIED that does not depend on its declared envelope says
  so in itself.
- Affine (zonotope) refinement layer for interval-undecided obligations,
  opt-in via `refine="affine"`.
- IEEE-semantics mode (opt-in): judges censused binary64 behaviours and
  stamps itself separately from real-mode verdicts.

### Overflow tripwire

- `pytest -p stelling.overflow` — hooks the constant-fold site where JAX
  silently narrows out-of-range integer literals during tracing.
- Reports each narrowing with source location, arithmetic, independent
  recomputation, and a one-line reproducer.
- **Gates the verifier**: when the tripwire is armed and a narrowing fires
  during a harness trace, the verdict is UNKNOWN — the pipeline refuses to
  certify a jaxpr that does not represent the program as written.
- xdist support: workers serialise findings back; the controller reports
  the true total and flags lost workers.
- Fail-closed on every JAX version change: probes in both directions at
  arm time, disables itself cleanly if the hook site moved.

### Architecture

- Zero required dependencies. JAX and SMT solvers are opt-in extras,
  imported lazily.
- `import stelling` never imports JAX. Only `stelling/_jax_compat.py` may
  import jax; enforced by pre-commit hook and test.
- REUSE-compliant (SPDX headers on every file), DCO-signed commits, PyPI
  Trusted Publishing with PEP 740 attestations.

### Known limitations

- Control flow (`cond`, `scan`, `while`) falls to top and is counted in
  coverage — not handled.
- Default semantics is real arithmetic (ℝ); a predicate can hold in ℝ and
  fail in floats. The stamp names this.
- The tripwire does not see `jnp.full`, `jnp.where`, `jnp.clip`, eager
  execution, or anything traced before the plugin armed. Each is documented
  and printed on every run.

Tested on JAX 0.10.2 and 0.11.0, Python 3.10–3.12, Linux x86_64.
